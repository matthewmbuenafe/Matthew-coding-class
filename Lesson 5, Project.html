            People have likely eaten wild strawberries for millennia, but cultivation officially began in the 1300s in Europe. People in France first transplanted the wild strawberry into the garden. In the 1600s, colonists discovered and shipped it to Europe. Though this species was hardy and delicious, it did not become popular until the end of the 1700s and early 1800s in England.

            The garden strawberry was first bred in Brittany, France, in the 1750s via a cross of Fragaria virginiana from eastern North America and Fragaria chiloensis, which was brought from Chile by Amédée-François Frézier in 1714.
